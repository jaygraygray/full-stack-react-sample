This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Full stack React/Node app, utilizing NYTimes APIs for a barebones browsing, searching, and reading experience.

WebPack Dev server will run on port 3000.
Node server will run on port 9998.

Add the NYTimes API key to the `server/config.js` file before launching.

From the root directory, run `npm i` to install React dependencies.
Run `nodemon` or a similar command to launch the Node server from the `/server` directory.
In another terminal, run `npm start` from the root directly.

The app will now be accessible at `http://localhost:3001`.
